  Site about Artifact | Full-stack developer | 09.2018 | [screenshots](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1RidLVceBWTP1dMExlAsfBqtLKODKQVo-?usp=sharing)

  Artifaction.gg - site about [valve](https://www.valvesoftware.com/en/) game - Artifact started by DOTA2/Esports enthusiasts well known in DOTA 2 community([@SirActionSlacks](https://twitter.com/@SirActionSlacks), [@Cyborgmatt](https://twitter.com/@Cyborgmatt), [@SUNSfanTV](https://twitter.com/@SUNSfanTV), [@bukkadota](https://twitter.com/@bukkadota), [@followNoxville](https://twitter.com/@followNoxville)) to build best community project where people may come for anything they want - casual videos, twitch shows, stats, tournaments, hot news, cards info, learning, cardsmith to make their own cards, deck builder, pathfinder and much more.

  I joined the team at the end of september. At start i wanted to make twitch extension - [concept here](https://imgur.com/a/xtcJO9o) later @bukkadota suggest me to help with site development and gave full freedom of choice of technology stack. 
  There was many changes in project structure/tech stack, here some solutions we use:
  - firebase cloud storage as CDN for UGC(raw images, thumbnails...)
  - firebase hosting - for static assets(js, html, css, images, fonts...)
  - cdn.artifaction.gg - repo for fetching images from artifact client and valve API -> processing them(trim, resize, convert) -> and save them in normalized structure. It use [ValveResourceFormat](https://github.com/SteamDatabase/ValveResourceFormat) to decompile assets from client.

  Twitch extension | Front-End developer & Co-founder | 04.2018 | [screenshots](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1BqGewZzHA5TSAwPi0dftpX47z6NAYIo1?usp=sharing)

  First of several exts using "Bits in Extensions". Selected by [Twitch.tv](https://twitch.tv/) for feature placement.

  Bubble Text - allows streamers to install an interactive speech bubble on their stream. Viewers can then use bits to get a set of text, animation and bubble style that will be displayed on the stream. By providing a variety of options, bubble text assures a unique and personalized experience for every user. This extension makes viewers feel more engaged by providing a gateway from Twitch to streamerâ€™s screen. For streamers, this extension gives an opportunity to monetize their stream by giving them a portion of each sale.
