    <summary>artifaction.gg</summary>

    Artifaction.gg - site about valve game - Artifact started by DOTA2/Esports enthusiasts well known in DOTA 2 community(@SirActionSlacks, @Cyborgmatt, @SUNSfanTV, @bukkadota, @followNoxville) to build best community project where people may come for anything they want - casual videos, twitch shows, stats, tournaments, hot news, cards info, learning, cardsmith to make their own cards, deck builder, pathfinder and much more.

    I joined the team at the end of september. At start i wanted to make twitch extension - concept here later @bukkadota suggest me to help with site development and gave full freedom of choice of technology stack. 
    There was many changes in project structure/tech stack, here some solutions we use:
    - firebase cloud storage as CDN for UGC(raw images, thumbnails...)
    - firebase hosting - for static assets(js, html, css, images, fonts...)
    - cdn.artifaction.gg - repo for fetching images from artifact client and valve API -> processing them(trim, resize, convert) -> and save them in normalized structure. It use ValveResourceFormat to decompile assets from client.
